## [Latency - Why it matters?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency)
A simplified, but helpful way to remember the relationship between latency, bandwidth and throughput is that bandwidth is the amount of data that could travel over a network, throughput is the measure of how much actually transfers per second, and latency is the time it takes to do so.
