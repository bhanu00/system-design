- [Reliability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/reliability.html)
- High Availability
    - [Understanding availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/availability-and-beyond-improving-resilience/understanding-availability.html) 
- Resiliency
    - [How to verify resiliancy of a cloud-native application](https://www.ibm.com/blog/a-four-step-approach-to-verifying-the-resiliency-of-cloud-native-applications/)
- Fault Tolerance
- Performance
- Maintenance
## [Latency - Why it matters?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency)
A simplified, but helpful way to remember the relationship between latency, bandwidth and throughput is that bandwidth is the amount of data that could travel over a network, throughput is the measure of how much actually transfers per second, and latency is the time it takes to do so.

- ### Subnetting
## [CAP Theorem](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cap-theorem)
This document explains about Consistency ([Strong vs Week](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eventual-vs-strong-consistency-in-distributed-databases/)), Availability, Partition tolerance and detailed about CAP theorem.

## Load Balancing and algorithms
- Algorithms used in Load balancing
    - Layman's Approach
    - Least Connections
    - Least Response Time
    - Round Robin
    - Weighted Round Robin
    - IP Hash
    - Consistent Hashing
