# How problem solving works?
When preparing for a problem-solving interview, there are a few key things you can do to improve your chances of success. First, make sure you have a good understanding of the basic principles of problem-solving, such as how to break a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts, and how to approach a problem in a logical and systematic way.

Next, it's important to practice your problem-solving skills by working through as many different types of problems as you can. This will help you develop a "toolkit" of strategies and techniques that you can use to tackle a wide range of problem-solving challenges. You can find practice problems online, or you can work through problem-solving books and guides to get a sense of the types of problems you may be asked to solve during the interview.

It's also a good idea to research the company you are interviewing with and try to get a sense of the types of problems they commonly face. This will allow you to come up with some potential solutions to those problems and be prepared to discuss them during the interview.

Finally, make sure to arrive at the interview well-rested and focused, so you can perform at your best. This may mean getting a good night's sleep the night before, eating a healthy breakfast, and taking some time to relax and clear your mind before the interview. By being well-prepared and focused, you'll be in the best position to succeed in a problem-solving interview.
