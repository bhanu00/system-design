## Note
Importantly, insecure design is not always accidental. One reason is that security may not be an organization’s top priority.
Acting securely involves people, effort, and time, and it can slow down business processes. For example, a business unit might 
request a new application to be quickly developed and released to capitalize on favorable market conditions; to do this the app’s 
developers might omit threat modeling or implementing security features in the app’s design.
